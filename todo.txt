Add z value for DrawableObjects and sort transparent ones (all of them lol) when drawing??
	-perhaps don't need to sort with draw instanced
	-investigate disabling depth buffer drawing as it's likely unnecessary
	-possible solution: have z value be the z coordinate, sort objects by z coord, draw in order (HOW? i'm using one draw call...)
Add way for objects to remove htemselves from a vector ie sprites or enemies vector using std::find()
Make jump only work if grounded
Add kill barrier:
	-sewer water sprite, that damages the player
	-nice and wide, but x pos is always player x pos
recude movement speed
	-compensate jump same distance
make player jump when successfully stopming enemy
